Sometimes I feel like programming/creating random projects. This page contains some examples.

## Advent of Code
[[GitHub](https://github.com/Drevanoorschot/AoC)]

The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly programming competition where each day of December till Christmas a new programming puzzle gets published. I often challenge myself to learn a new programming language or teach myself some more advanced programming features during this event.

## xkcd Discord Bot
[[GitHub](https://github.com/Drevanoorschot/AoC)] [[Add](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=839927624327495701&permissions=2064&scope=bot)]

A Discord bot hooked into the [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) API. It posts the latest xkcd comic in the *#xkcd* channel as soon as it is published.

## Spotify Pruner
[[GitHub](https://github.com/Drevanoorschot/Spotify-Playlist-Pruner)]

Spotify playlist management tool which can mirror collaborative playlist to a public playlist and prune songs to a set limit (i.e. remove the oldest songs once a set limit is exceeded).

## Portfolio
